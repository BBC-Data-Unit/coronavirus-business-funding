# Coronavirus: Millions for small business 'sitting in council accounts'

In August 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-53692785) on £1.5bn of unclaimed emergency coronavirus funding for firms, which would go back to the Treasury at the end of the month if it is not claimed.

Emergency grants for businesses in England were announced on 17 March.

Lump sums of £10,000, through the Small Business Grant Fund, and £25,000 through the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund, were intended to help businesses' cash flows during the coronavirus pandemic.
